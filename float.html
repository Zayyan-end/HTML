            Dogs are domesticated descendants of wolves, the first animals tamed by humans, known for their incredible sense of
            smell (40-100,000 times better than ours) and ability to learn over 100 words, making them loyal companions, service
            animals (detecting diseases), and intuitive friends that understand emotions and even dream, with unique nose prints
            like human fingerprints.
